            <h3>Message from the Chair</h3>
            <p>As a long-time resident of Brinnington, it is my privilege to serve as Chair of the Big Local and to be part of a group of people whose passion, energy, determination, and commitment have supported the planning and delivery of projects that make a difference to so many people in Brinnington. Local decision-making and partnership working are at the core of The Big Local’s ambitions. Our shared goals and vision help bring people and organizations together to ensure our community thrives.</p>
            <p>It's this spirit that has enabled and mobilized numerous projects that support our residents, especially during challenging times. We plan to continue this work, building on our services and projects, developing new initiatives, and collaborating with partners to create lasting change.</p>
            <p>In 2022, we started a new three-year plan with the same vigor and passion the committee is known for. It's worth noting that it's not just us helping the community; it's them helping us too. Our volunteers, who dedicate their time selflessly, drive us to learn more and do more.</p>
            <p>This year, we celebrated all our volunteers to recognize the impacts they make within our community. Our collaborative approach has led to tangible impacts, changing lives, and making vital services accessible. Together, we are determined to leave a legacy that benefits everyone and ensures our work is sustainable.</p>
            <p>I'm proud to be part of a community whose determination and spirit help shape, co-design, and deliver projects that drive real change and make our community better.</p>
