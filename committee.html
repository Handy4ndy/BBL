            <p>here we will have an introduction about the committee</p>

            <p>As a long-time resident of Brinnington it is my privilege to serve as Chair of the Big Local and to be part of a group of people whose passion, energy, determination and commitment has supported the planning and delivery of projects and where our work has made the difference to so many people within Brinnington.  Local decision-making and partnership working are part of our DNA and always at the heart of The Big Local’s ambitions. Our commonality of purpose, shared goals and vision helps to bring people and organisations together to make sure our community flourishes and thrives. It is this spirit, which has enabled and mobilised many projects, which has supported our resident’s during the most difficult of times. We plan to do more over the next three years and build on our existing services and projects, create, develop and implement more initiatives and continue to work with our partners to make real and lasting change.  
                We started our new three-year plan in 2022, with the vigour and passion our committee have become known for.  I often say that people think that we are helping them by providing a wide range of services, projects, events and activities.  But it is them that help us too: by taking part, providing honest feedback and driving us as volunteers to learn more and do more to help all of us.   
                I was delighted this year to be able to celebrate ALL those volunteers who give their time selflessly and work tirelessly for and with the community. We held a volunteer celebration event to recognise the impacts that our volunteers make within our community.  It was our way to say thank you for all that they do to make Brinnington a better place for everyone.  
                Our collaborative approach has driven impacts and outcomes which has changed lives, brought vital services to Brinnington, enhanced our offer and provision for everyone within our community. Together we have upskilled volunteers, supported survivors of domestic abuse, made more services accessible, and helped those who are socially isolated or who experience mental or physical health barriers.   
                We are all determined to leave a legacy that will benefit everyone and ensure the work we do is sustainable. I am proud to be part of a community whose determination and spirit helps to shape, co-design and deliver projects that drives real change to make our community better.
