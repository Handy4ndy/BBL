            <p> The Big Local is a lottery-funded scheme to make lasting change in disadvantaged areas, creating a better place to
                live. Brinnington Big Local is a community-led group consisting of passionate and skilled local people, working
                together to meet the needs of the Brinnington area. <br>The groupâ€™s priorities are determined by community consultation
                and engagement, targeting issues such as food poverty, anti-social behaviour, financial hardship, domestic abuse,
                unemployment and health and wellbeing. </p>
            
            
            <p>We are passionate about engaging and involving local people, listening to them on what is important to them as
                individuals and groups and using this information to feed into and shape projects that will be benefit everyone in
                our community. We are determined to create a safer and greener environment, improve the personal health and
                wellbeing of residents, whilst supporting the learning and upskilling of our local people. <br>
            
                We have created, co-designed and delivered projects that help people to become more connected with their environment
                and each other. This approach has helped to turn aspirations and wishes into reality and practical solutions. </p>
